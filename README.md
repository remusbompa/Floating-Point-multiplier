# Floating-Point-multiplier
Implemented in VHDL a floating point multiplier which receives two IEEE 754 normalized numbers and return the product in IEEE 754 format. The designed is based on a 3-stages pipeline: add exponents and multiply mantissas, correct the exponent, normalize and adjust exponent. To increase performance, it uses a multiplication matrix circuit for binary multiplication of mantissas.
